					<h1>Teh</h1>
					<h3>Tea-ching us about Multiculturalism in Singapore</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						Today I'll be talking about teh, kind of like the ones you always see old uncles drinking at the kopitiams. I'll be exploring the concept of teas in a singaporean context, and attempt to show some of the insights that an understanding of this journey of tea can reveal about a multicultural society like Singapore.

					<h2>Scope</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Tea as a representation of different cultures in society</li>
						<li>Understanding the similarities and differences between different teas and how that relates to Singapore's racial harmony</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						When the migrants first came to singapore, they brought with them snippets of their existing cultures which manifested itself in a formless singaporean culture. One aspect of these cultures include their traditional teas, which are typically brewed with local leaves. Certain cultures have different preferences, and may add sugar or milk or other spices. It will be important for us to understand the similarities and differences between different teas and how that relates to racial harmony.

						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's take a look at Chinese tea, which represents one of the larger ethnicities in singapore. Chinese tea is typically brewed plain without additional milk/sugar, and has very deep roots in Chinese culture. Today, it is very much a part of our culture even though many of us may not realize it. Bak kut teh, one of Singapore's more famous dishes, actually comprises of pork ribs and chinese tea. Originally a teochew dish, it is now arguably a dish that ALMOST every singaporean enjoys today. The prominent role that Chinese tea plays in this unique dish that is now enjoyed by people of all races demonstrates how Singaporeans have developed to accept other types of tea besides that offered by their original heritages.The chinese aside, migrants from other ethnicities brought teas of their own too, such as....

						<p>Does this necessarily imply a dilution of authenticity?</p>
						<blockquote class="fragment">
							&ldquo;the mixing of diverse populations and their cultures may not necessarily lead to the resultant melting of their individual group characteristic&rdquo;<br/><br/>- Glazer and Moynihan, 1975
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							Given  all the various teas each with its critics and supporters, one may expect a dilution of authenticity of each tea, resulting in a new “Singaporean tea”. However, according to Glazer and Moynihan, this isn't necessarily so. To a certain extent, I do agree with them and I will be covering two key points in this presentation.

						<h2>Talking about Tea</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Teh Susu vs Teh Si?</li>
							<br/>
							<blockquote class="fragment">
								&ldquo;perhaps there is a need to revisit our conceptual assumptions, and realize that ethnic identity is not immutable as it appears to be, but is instead subject to the ongoing construction of its contents, meanings and boundaries in changing contexts&rdquo;<br/><br/>- Keyes, 1981
							</blockquote>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's talk about tea. Language is yet another unique aspect of one's culture. Some say that language is a construct to facilitate communication, while others argue that they are the very representation of ideas themselves. What I find interesting is the way that the same beverage can be referred to in a multitude of different ways. Take for example teh susu and teh si. They both refer to tea with milk. Teh susu is a term used by Malaysians and Indonesians, while Teh Si is typically used by dialect-speaking Chinese. How then, did two distinct ethnic groups with two different concepts of tea come to refer to the same tea with a different name?

						<h1><span class="fragment highlight-red">Teh</span> <span class="fragment highlight-blue">Tarik</span></h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Teh Tarik is another interesting case. The word teh is a hokkien term, while tarik means pull in bahasa. Ironically, this drink that is famously enjoyed around singapore, is rarely prepared by either ethnicity.

					<h2>Cultural Changes</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Given Singapore's diverse mix of cultures, one needs to be sensitive to the tastes of others</li>
						<li>Especially so for Hawkers who make their living off understanding their customer's preferences</li>
						<li>Each tea has distinct character and identity, but have absorbed influences from other teas</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						While it can be interesting to study how certain teas in Singapore arose out of the combination of others, one must not diminish the unique characteristics that certain teas in Singapore have managed to retain. Although many of these teas has changed comparably, it has absorbed various influences to better suit the tastes of the wider Singaporean community.

						<h2>Case Study: Indian Teas</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Local Flavors vs Traditional Spice Teas?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Singaporean variants: Teh Chino, Teh Halia etc.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Traditionally not pulled. The "tarik" component was borrowed from Malay/Indonesian Teas.</li>
						</ul>

							Take indian hawkers for example. Traditional indian tea was originally spicy, but is vastly different from what we experience today.

						<h3>"Indian" Teh Tarik</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Teas of different cultures cross paths at different points in time
								<ul><li class="fragment">The availability of both indian tea leaves and the common tarik techniques</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>And developing beyond their original tastes</li>
							<li>While retaining the original flavors that make them unique
								<ul><li class="fragment">Indian teas, although pulled and of a variety of flavors now, are still made with the same leaves</li></ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Take the "indian" teh tarik for example. It is the result of teas from different cultures that have crossed paths at different points in time, and developed beyond their original tastes while retaining the original flavors that make them unique. This can be observed as the union of indian tea leaves and common tarik techniques, resulting in the wide variety of indian teas today that are still made of the original indian tea leaves.

						<h2>Moving forward</h2>
						<p>The teas enjoyed by Singaporeans today are the result of constant iteration and reinvention over the years.</p>
						<p>Perhaps what made Singapore unique was this indifference towards a food/beverage item, which translates to how people treat each other.</p>
